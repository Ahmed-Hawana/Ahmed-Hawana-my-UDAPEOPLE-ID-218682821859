## UDAPEOPLE
This is a project to develop the UdaPeople product, a revolutionary concept in Human Resources which promises to help small businesses care better for their most valuable resource: their people.

## Section 1 - 
      Explain the Fundamentals and Benefits of CI/CD 
          to Achieve, Build, and Deploy Automation for Cloud-Based Software Products.

          - In the root Folder
                * presentation.pdf
                * Diagram of CI/CD Pipeline we will be building. (UdaPeople Pipeline.png) and (UdaPeople Pipeline.drawio)

## Section 2 - 
    # Geting Started:
      1- Building Frontend and Backend.
      2- Unit Test Phase.
      3- Analysis and vulnerability scan.
      4- Email Alert Settings.
    # Local Deployment:
      1- Docker and Postgres db added locally.
      2- Backend node dependancies.
      3- Frontend node dependancies.
      4- set enviromental variables.
      5- Run DB migration.
      6- lunch in development mode.
      7- build applications on production backend and frontend.
    # Starting with AWS:
      1- create EC2 keypair "udacity"
      2- create IAM user "udapeople-circleci-runner".
      3- Add postgres SQL DB in AWS RDS which is public.
      4- Cloudfront destribution
            a- choose random string "a01a01", create public S3 bucket "udapeople-random string"
            b- run circleci/files/cloudfront.yml
      5- Circleci 
            a- ADD the EC2 Key pair.

      6- Deploy Infrastructure
            a- Install AWSCLI
            b- Ensure Backend Infrastructure 
            c- Ensure frontend Infrastructure
            d- add ip address to Ansible Inventory
            e- persist inventory file to workspace
            f- add rollback command in case of failure:
                  - Delete backend stack
                  - Empty frontend bucket
                  - Delete front end stack
      7- Configure Infrastructure
            a- Configure server Ansible playbook
            b- Configure server Ansible task
            c- Update Prometheus Node Exporter to latest version.
            d- complete job steps in config.yml
      8- Migration
            a- create account on kvdb.io
            b- Store kvdb bucket name on CircleCi
            c- run migration script on Nodejs
            d- add revert migration
      9- Deployment at production
            a- Deploy backend production app to EC2 instance
            b- Deploy frontend production static files to S3 bucket
      10- Smoketest
            a- run on backend
            b- run on frontend
      11- Promotion and cleanup
            a- store last workflow ID exported by initial stack to be used later.
            b- Update initial stack cloudfront to point to the latest frontend bucket
            c- after successful update, delete all old stacks.
