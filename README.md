## UDAPEOPLE
This is a project to develop the UdaPeople product, a revolutionary concept in Human Resources which promises to help small businesses care better for their most valuable resource: their people.

## Section 1 - 
      Explain the Fundamentals and Benefits of CI/CD 
          to Achieve, Build, and Deploy Automation for Cloud-Based Software Products.

                * Diagram of CI/CD Pipeline we will be building. (UdaPeople Pipeline.png) and (UdaPeople Pipeline.drawio)

## Section 2 - 
    # Geting Started:
      1- Building Frontend and Backend.
      2- Unit Test Phase.
      3- Analysis and vulnerability scan.
      4- Email Alert Settings.

# ScreenShots
    On the root Folder my screenshots folder contains:-
      - screenshots in JPG, named using the screenshot number listed as follow:
          1. Job failed because of compile errors. [SCREENSHOT01].
          2. Job failed because of unit tests. [SCREENSHOT02].
              for the backend and [SCREENSHOT02-2] for the frontend.
          3. Job that failed because of vulnerable packages. [SCREENSHOT03]
              for the backend and [SCREENSHOT03-2] for the frontend.
          4. An alert from one of my failed builds. [SCREENSHOT04]          4.
